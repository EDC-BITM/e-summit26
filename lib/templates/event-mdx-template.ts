## Introduction

The **Investor Summit** is the flagship financial module of **E-Summit '26**. It is designed not as a conventional competition, but as a **high-fidelity deal pipeline**. The event connects high-potential startups with **Angel Investors and Venture Capitalists (VCs)** to facilitate **seed funding and strategic mentorship**.

The core philosophy is **"Validation First."** Investors are not exposed to raw ideas. A rigorous screening process ensures only vetted startups reach the final stage. The summit functions as a **high-stakes boardroom pitch**, enabling immediate expressions of interest.
